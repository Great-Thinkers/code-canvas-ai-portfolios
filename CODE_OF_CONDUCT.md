- Be respectful and considerate in speech and actions.
- Refrain from harassment, discrimination, or exclusionary behavior.
- Accept constructive feedback gracefully and offer it kindly.
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences.

Unacceptable behavior includes harassment, discrimination, or any conduct that creates an unsafe or hostile environment.
